## Credits

I used the tools that I've learned in Rice university Boot Camp as well as research in MDN, Stack Overflow and Jquery API documentation online.  I recieved information on setting up the live bar during office hours. I also recieved help from David Elutilo during a tutoring session on March 24th 2023 on setting items to local storage.
